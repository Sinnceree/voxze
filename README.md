Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm a 20-year old, self-taught software engineer currently located in Philadelphia. I currently have plans to receive a degree in computer science to further educate my self in this field. I've been developing different software applications over the last 5 years. I am fluent in many technologies, I primarily write my frontend applications in React, Golang, server side stuff in NodeJS, while using PostgreSQL to handle data management.
